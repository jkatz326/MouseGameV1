MouseGame Version 1 README

Joseph Katz, Penn '26

This is an original two-person, pass-and-play game designed as a final project for CIS 1200. 
It is little rough around the edges, but my friends have had fun with it. Basically, the game 
inherits the back and forth guessing of battleship, but players set traps instead of shooting 
missiles and can also move their hidden "mouse" to evade capture. In a future version, I plan 
on improving the graphics and finishing up save state functionality.
