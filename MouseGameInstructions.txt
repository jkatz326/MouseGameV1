“The goal of MouseGame is to catch your opponent’s mouse before you mouse is caught. 
In a moment, you will each be asked to input three pieces of information aside from your name: 
a pair of starting coordinates, a distance that your mouse will move throughout the game, 
and a “special move” pattern (ex. North 3 spaces then West 2 spaces). 
All of this information will be secret throughout the game so make sure that 
your opponent can’t see you type it in.

Each turn, you will be able to choose one of the following five actions. 
The same action cannot be chosen two turns in a row.

Standard Move: You can choose to move your mouse North, South, East, or West. 
Your mouse will move in the number of spaces that you chose at the beginning of the game. 
The direction will be publicly known but not the distance. 

Special Move: You can choose to move your mouse in the pattern 
you decided on at the beginning of the game. 

Add Trap: You can add a trap to one square of your Lab Grid. 
If your opponent’s mouse ever runs over a trap, they lose the game. 

Add Laser: You can add a laser to a column or row of your Lab Grid. 
Whenever your opponent’s mouse runs past or on a column or row with a laser, the game sends 
out a notification that a laser was triggered. Ex. If player 2 places lasers at columns C, E, and G 
and player 1’s mouse later moves from 3B to 3F, player 2 will receive a notification that two lasers were triggered. 

Spook: When you choose to “spook” your opponent’s mouse, the mouse will move a randomly generated 
number of spaces (between 1 and 6) in the direction of your choosing. The game will send out a 
message giving both you and your opponent an inexact idea of how far the mouse moved 
(“a little spooked” if moved 1 or 2 spaces, “quite spooked” for 3 or 4, and “extremely spooked” for 5 or 6).”
